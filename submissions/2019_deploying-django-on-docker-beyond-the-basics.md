# Deploying Django on Docker - beyond the basics

## Submitted by

Michael Herman

## Description

Docker is a containerization tool used for spinning up isolated, reproducible application environments.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to productionize a Django Project (along with Postgres and Redis) on AWS EC2. We'll also look at how to work with other AWS services for managing static assets, sending transactional emails, handling data persistence, and processing batch jobs.


## Audience

This is an intermediate-level tutorial geared toward those that have experience with Django, Docker, and AWS in general.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to...

1. Explain how to take a containerized Django project and deploy it to AWS
2. Deploy a Django project to Amazon EC2 with Docker
3. Utilize Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for data persistence
4. Configure an Amazon S3 bucket to load and serve up static files
