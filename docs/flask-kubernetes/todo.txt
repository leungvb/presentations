1. nodeport vs loadbalancer vs ingress

There are three ways to expose your Kubernetes application to external users:

Use a Kubernetes service of type NodePort to expose the application on a port across all nodes.
Use a Kubernetes service of type LoadBalancer to create an external load balancer that points to a service in your cluster.
Use a Kubernetes Ingress resource to define host- or URL-based HTTP routing rules that specify how external users access services running in your cluster.

Why should web developers care about Kubernetes?
