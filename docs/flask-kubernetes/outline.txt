Scaling Flask with Kubernetes

Blurb: In this talk, Michael Herman (https://mherman.org/) will first explain Kubernetes from a high-level and then he'll show how to deploy a Flask-based microservice (along with Postgress and Vue.js) to a managed Kubernetes cluster.

Theory:

1. What is container orchestration?
2. What is Kubernetes and why should you use it?
3. Why should web developers care about Kubernetes?

Practice:

1. Google SDK
1. Kubectl
1. Create cluster
1. Image registry
1. Helm
1. Postgres
1. Cloud storage for static files
1. Flask
1. Ingress
