## Theory

---

### What is Vault?

--

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is an open-source tool used for securely storing and managing secrets.

<img src="images/vault-logo2.png" alt="vault logo" style="width:30%;padding-top:20px;">

--

#### Secrets?

--

Secrets are securely-sensitive or personally identifiable info like database credentials, SSH keys, usernames/passwords, AWS IAM credentials, API tokens, SSNs, credit card numbers.
--

#### Distributing secrets

1. Who has access to them?
1. Who manages them?
1. How do you control who has access to them?
1. How do your apps get them?
1. How are they updated?
1. How are they revoked?

---

### Why Vault?

--

Vault provides answers to the questions on the previous slide and helps to solve the following problems with secret management:

| Current problems                                   | Vault's Goals                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Secrets are everywhere.                            | Vault is the single source of truth for all secrets.     |
| They are generally unencrypted.                    | Vault manages encryption (during transit and at rest) out of the box. |
| It's difficult to dynamically generate them.       | Secrets can be dynamically generated.                       |
| It's even more difficult to lease and revoke them. | Secrets can be leased and revoked.                       |
| There's no audit trail.                            | There's an audit trail for generating and using secrets. |

### Using Vault (1)

--

#### Secret Management

Vault has two types of secrets:

1. **[Static](https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/secret-mgmt/static-secrets.html)** secrets (think encrypted Redis or Memcached) have refresh intervals but they do not expire unless explicitly revoked. They are defined ahead of time and then shared.

    <img src="images/vault-secure_secret_storage.png" alt="secure secret storage" style="width:50%;">

1. **[Dynamic](https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/dynamic-secrets.html)** secrets have enforced leases and generally expire after a short period of time. Since they don‚Äôt exist until they are accessed, there‚Äôs less exposure - so dynamic secrets are much more secure.

--

#### Encryption as a Service

The [Transit](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit/index.html) backend can be used as an "encryption as a service":

1. Encrypt and decrypt data "in-transit" without storing it
1. Easily integrate encryption into your application workflow

---

### Using Vault (2)

--

Backends are everywhere!

| Backend                                                                      | Use                                      | Examples                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Storage](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/index.html) | Where secrets are stored                 | Consul, Filesystem, In-Memory, PostgreSQL, S3                  |
| [Secret](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/index.html)                | Handles static or dynamic secrets        | AWS, Databases, Key/Value, RabbitMQ, SSH                       |
| [Auth](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/index.html)                     | Handles authentication and authorization | AWS, Azure, Google Clouds, GitHub, Tokens, Username & Password |
| [Audit](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/index.html)                    | Logs all requests                        | File, Syslog, Socket                                           |

## Practice

---

### Project Overview

https://github.com/testdrivenio/vault-docker-example

```sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îî‚îÄ vault
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vault-config.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ audit.log
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ policies
```

--

Build the image and run the container:


```sh
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

Start a bash session within the running container and add Vault to `$PATH`:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec vault bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/vault
```

---

### Storage Backends

--

Vault works with a number of storage backends that are used for storing the secrets - in-memory, files, various SQL and NoSQL databases, Consul, S3, etc.

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/index.html

--

To keep things simple, the examples in this presentation use the [Filesystem](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/filesystem.html) backend:

```json
{
  "backend": {
    "file": {
      "path": "vault/data"
    }
  },
  "listener": {
    "tcp":{
      "address": "0.0.0.0:8200",
      "tls_disable": 1
    }
  },
  "ui": true
}
```

---


### Init, Unseal, and Authenticate

--

Initialize Vault:

```sh
$ vault operator init
```

Take note of the unseal keys and the initial root token. You will need to provide 3 of the unseal keys every time the Vault server is re-sealed.

<small><em>(Why 3 tokens? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing)</em></small>

--

Now you can unseal the Vault using 3 of the keys:

```sh
$ vault operator unseal
```

Authenticate:

```sh
$ vault login
Token (will be hidden):
```

This uses the root policy. In production you'll want to set up policies with different levels of access.

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html

---

### Auditing

--

Before we test out the functionality, let‚Äôs enable an [Audit Device](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/audit/index.html):

```sh
$ vault/vault audit enable file file_path=/vault/logs/audit.log
Success! Enabled the file audit device at: file/
```

--

To test, run the following command to view all enabled Audit Devices:

```sh
$ vault/vault audit list

Path     Type    Description
----     ----    -----------
file/    file    n/a
```

This request should be logged in *vault/logs/audit.log*.

---

### Static Secrets

--

Vault can be managed through the [CLI](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/index.html), [HTTP API](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/index.html), or [UI](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/ui/index.html).

--

#### CLI Examples

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/index.html

Create:

```sh
$ vault kv put secret/foo bar=precious
Success! Data written to: secret/foo
```

Read:

```sh
$ vault kv get secret/foo
```

Delete:

```sh
$ vault kv delete secret/foo
```

--

<br>

Take note of the audit log. Each of the above requests were logged!

---

### Dynamic Secrets (1)

--

Vault supports a number of dynamic secret backends for generating secrets dynamically when needed.

For example, with the [AWS](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/index.html) and [Google Cloud](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/gcp/index.html), backends you can create access credentials based on IAM policies. The [databases](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/databases/index.html) backend, meanwhile, generates database credentials based on configured roles.

--

*Dynamic Secrets:*

- are generated on demand
- have limited access based on role
- are "leased"
- can be revoked
- come with an audit trail

---

### Dynamic Secrets (2)

--

#### Generate dynamic, on-demand AWS access credentials

Enable:

```sh
$ vault secrets enable -path=aws aws
Success! Enabled the aws secrets engine at: aws/
```

Authenticate:

```sh
$ vault write aws/config/root access_key=foo secret_key=bar
Success! Data written to: aws/config/root
```

Create role and credentials:

```sh
$ vault write aws/roles/ec2-read arn=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess
$ vault read aws/creds/ec2-read
```

--

*Secrets are generated when they are requested (i.e., a web app requests access to S3). They are not available in the store before this.*

https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/dynamic-secrets.html

---

### Encryption as a Service

--

Enable transit:

```sh
$ vault secrets enable transit
Success! Enabled the transit secrets engine at: transit/
```

--

Configure named encryption key:

```sh
$ vault write -f transit/keys/foo
Success! Data written to: transit/keys/foo
```

--

Encrypt and decrypt:

```sh
$ vault write transit/encrypt/foo plaintext=$(base64 <<< "my precious")
Key           Value
---           -----
ciphertext    vault:v1:/Tun95IT+dVTvDfYiCHdI5rGPSAxgvPcFaDDtneRorQCyBOgv9mPKw==

$ vault write transit/decrypt/foo ciphertext=vault:v1:/Tun95IT+dVTvDfYiCHdI5rGPSAxgvPcFaDDtneRorQCyBOgv9mPKw==
Key          Value
---          -----
plaintext    bXkgcHJlY2lvdXMK

$ base64 -d <<< "bXkgcHJlY2lvdXMK"
my precious
```
