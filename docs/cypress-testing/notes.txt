Assumptions:

(1) Talk is meant for an intermediate to advanced-level JavaScript web developer.
(2) This is not my first time teaching this audience. No need for an intro, in other words.
(3) The class is already familiar with the "I do, We do, You do" approach.

Full disclosure:

(1) I spoke on this topic at DenverScript last month. Most of the theory parts were taken from that talk.
